Abstruct Factory

The abstract factory pattern is a design pattern that provides a way 
to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete 
classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a 
common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

For example:
A server can response visual responses to two different markup 
interprators. Abstruct factory pattern can be used to switch responses 
you want by assigning related factories.
