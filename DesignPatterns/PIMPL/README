PIMPL - Pointer to İmplementation
This idiom is used to minimizes dependency to class implementation. 
It improves compilation times, since changes in main class code, does 
not require recompilation of the whole source code. It also provide a 
stable application binary interface. i.e. uses of main class don’t 
rely on implementation class.
