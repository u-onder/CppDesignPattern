RAI - Resource Allocation is Initialization

This idioms is constructor and destructor pattern, which means doing 
something in constructor and undoing in destructor. This binds the 
resources to the lifetime of an objects. It guarantees the resources 
are available within the full lifetime of the object, and freed after 
destruction of an object.
