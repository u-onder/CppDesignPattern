Singleton

Is used if you want to create "one" instance of an object.

The definition of "one" may change application to application. Is it one 
in an app or one in system or one in the entire world?

The simple implemention may cause race condition during instance 
creation. Although there are double check mechanisms using mutexes, 
compilers does not guarantie real binary implementation following 
implementation instruction order. But meyers version overcomes this 
race condition issue.
